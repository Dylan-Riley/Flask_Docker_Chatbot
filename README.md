# Flask_Docker_Chatbot

Quick demo of a intents-based chatbot running in a flask web service

Bot is trained in train.py off of intents.json and then saves its work in the .pkl and itself in the .h5 files. Bot is then ran in app.py, which just running this can then be connected to at localhost:5000

Docker functionality now confirmed, can successfully build and run inside a docker container, also on localhost:5000
